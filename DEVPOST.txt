# r/factchecker - AWS Lambda Hackathon Submission

## Project Title
r/factchecker - AI-Powered Fact-Checking Browser Extension

## Elevator Pitch
Combat misinformation directly in your browser! r/factchecker uses AWS Lambda to instantly verify Reddit posts, URLs, and selected text with AI-powered analysis.

## Inspiration
• Misinformation spreads faster than facts online
• Users need instant verification without leaving their browsing context
• Fact-checking should be as seamless as spell-checking

## What it does
• Instantly analyzes Reddit posts, URLs, and selected text for credibility
• Provides AI-powered credibility scores with visual indicators
• Works directly in browser via popup and right-click context menu
• Highlights suspicious content and provides trusted source recommendations

## How I built it
• Frontend: JavaScript browser extension with Manifest V3 APIs
• Backend: AWS Lambda functions triggered by API Gateway
• Integration: Serverless fact-checking with sub-second response times
• APIs: Reddit API, news sources, and AI analysis services

## Challenges I ran into
• Browser extension security policies and CORS restrictions with AWS Lambda endpoints
• Optimizing Lambda cold starts for real-time performance
• Balancing thorough fact-checking with instant user feedback

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
• Built fully functional browser extension from scratch
• Achieved sub-second AWS Lambda response times
• Seamless integration between browser APIs and serverless backend

## What I learned
• Browser extension security policies and API limitations
• AWS Lambda optimization for fast cold starts
• Serverless architecture design patterns

## What's next for r/factchecker
• Enhanced AI models with machine learning improvements
• Multi-browser support (Firefox, Edge, Safari)
• Integration with academic databases

## How AWS Lambda was used in this project
• **Serverless Fact-Checking Engine**: Lambda functions process all content analysis when users right-click or use extension popup, returning credibility scores in real-time
• **API Gateway Triggers**: HTTP endpoints trigger Lambda execution for Reddit post verification, URL analysis, and text fact-checking requests from browser extension
• **Auto-Scaling Processing**: Lambda handles concurrent fact-check requests without infrastructure management, automatically scaling based on user demand
• **External API Integration**: Lambda functions connect to Reddit API, news sources, and fact-checking databases to verify claims and calculate credibility scores
• **Cost-Effective Architecture**: Pay-per-request model with sub-second response times, ensuring zero costs during idle periods while maintaining instant fact-checking capability
